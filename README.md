# EasyGnss
An approach in which only GPS satellites are used in Sp3 and RINEX data and receiver coordinates are calculated by adjustment calculation using the least squares method and the position of the receiver at different times is used.
In order for the software to work, the GnssPy Library developed by Mustafa Serkan Işık and Volkan Özbey must be installed. The Customtkinter library must be installed for the GUI to work.
