## Introduction

This repository contains an approach to calculate receiver coordinates using GPS satellites' Sp3 and RINEX data through adjustment calculation with the least squares method. The software allows you to determine the position of the receiver at different times, utilizing the capabilities of the GnssPy Library developed by Mustafa Serkan Işık and Volkan Özbey. Additionally, for a graphical user interface (GUI) functionality, you need to install the CustomTkinter library.

## Getting Started

To use this software, follow the steps below:

1. Install GnssPy Library: Visit the [GnssPy GitHub repository](https://github.com/GNSSpy-Project/gnsspy) for installation instructions and documentation.

2. Install CustomTkinter: For the GUI functionality, you need to install the CustomTkinter library. Find the installation guide and source code in the [CustomTkinter GitHub repository](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).

## Usage


To use EasyGnss, follow these steps:

1. Install GnssPy Library: Visit the [GnssPy GitHub repository](https://github.com/GNSSpy-Project/gnsspy) for installation instructions and documentation.

2. Install CustomTkinter: For the GUI functionality, you need to install the CustomTkinter library. Find the installation guide and source code in the [CustomTkinter GitHub repository](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).

3. Place all files in a single directory: After making the necessary installations, gather all the project files in one directory.

4. Run the main.py file: Launch the application by running the `main.py` file. This will open the GUI interface.

5. Select RINEX and Sp3 files: In the GUI, choose the RINEX and Sp3 files from your local storage.

6. After selecting the required files, click the "Calculate Position of Reciver" button to initiate the receiver coordinates calculation.

7. View the results: Once the calculation is complete, you will see the position of the receiver at different times based on the GPS data.

Feel free to explore and use the additional features provided by EasyGnss to enhance your GPS data processing experience.
